# PERT-Project-Manager

## PROJECT MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE USING CPM

### INTRODUCTION
CPM and PERT are important tools for planning, scheduling, and coordinating the overall activities of large-scale projects. PERT was developed by a group of engineers from the US Navy when they were in charge of the Missile project in 1958. Although these two techniques (PERT and CPM) were developed independently, they are only superficially different. There are so many similarities between these two techniques and nowadays these techniques together are called critical path analysis (CPA). CPM and PERT techniques are usually discussed in project management training.

### OVERVIEW
We have created a website that helps anyone to manage their projects in an optimal way using the CPM algorithm. The site offers the client to create their account, and store their projects, and the corresponding CPM diagrams on the site Moreover it helps the client to find the critical path which should be followed to complete the project within the least time possible. The site also explains the theorem and conditions that need to be followed to get the right output.
